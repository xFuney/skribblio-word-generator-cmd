# Skribbl.io Word Generator
__This is the command-line version of the skribbl.io word generator I made with Windows Forms, you can find that [here](https://github.com/xFuney/skribblio-word-generator).__

This program takes a newline-separated TXT file and converts it into a CSV format ready to be copy/pasted into a skribbl.io game.

This was thrown together to make taking an over 50-entry newline-separated word pool and converting it to a compatible CSV format much simpler, as I'm pretty lazy and wanted to get it done as quick as possible.

# Text File Syntax
This program accepts newline-separated text files, the syntax is below.
```
these
are
words
that
will
be
parsed
by
the
program
- this will not, as this is a comment.
- comments are delimited by a dash.
- this allows you to separate "categories" for better legibility
```
Some sample text files will be available here soon.
